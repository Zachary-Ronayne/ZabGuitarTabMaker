# ZabGuitarTabMaker
A Java application for creating guitar tabs

Currently the versions folder contains each iteration of the program, which stand alone .jar files to create guitar tabs.
It has limited functionality, but feel free to download it and play around with it.
The .jar file is all that is needed to run the program, simply run the jar, and the GUI editor should open.
The .jar will generate two folders, ZabData and saves, which are used by the program.
ZabData currently just holds the theme (dark or light), and saves is the default location for saving/loading/exporting.
