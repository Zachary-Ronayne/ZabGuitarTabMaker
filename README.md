# ZabGuitarTabMaker
A Java application for creating guitar tabs

Currently the beta 1_0 version exists and can be used as a stand alone .jar file to create tabs.
It has limited functionality, but feel free to download it and play around with it.
The .jar file is all that is needed to run the program, simply run the jar, and the GUI editor should open.
The .jar will generate two folders, ZabData and saves, which are used by the program.
